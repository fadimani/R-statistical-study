# R-statistical-study
A summer internship is an excellent opportunity for any who pursues the engineering disciplines. Students get the chance to see what a real-world work environment is like, apply their theoretical knowledge to the field and gain invaluable experience that will help their resumes stand out, bolstering their career prospects and undoubtedly making them better engineers. However, many students struggle to land a summer internship and some choose a different path altogether.

The aim of this statistical study is to determine how the 3rd year students of ENSAK of “genie informatique” and “genie industrielle” see summer internships and whether they find it difficult to secure one. And if there’s a correlation between their perception of these two notions.

In hopes of tackling this issue, we decided to look for an answer to this research question: does the students’ perception of the importance of internships affect their perception of the difficulty to find one?

Our research hypothesis is that there is a positive correlation between the students’ perception of the importance of internships and their perception of the difficulty to find one. 

In our research, We used a probabilistic method of sampling, based on stratified sampling.
Our explanatory variable will be the perception on the importance of internships and the reactionary variable will be the perception on the difficulty to find one.
